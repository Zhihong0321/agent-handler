      "principle": "Use realistic, conservative projections",

    },
    {
      "principle": "Anchor conversation around bill transformation, not system price",
      "explanation": "Switching RM300 TNB bill into RM50 bill + RM300 asset installment reframes solar as investment, not expense."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Address reliability concerns early",
      "explanation": "Warranty, tier-1 brands, and proven financing partners like Maybank reduce fear of long-term failures."

      "customer_question": "How sure are you my bill can really drop so much?",

      "alternative_phrasings": [
        "Our numbers are based on the lowest sun-hour assumptions so you get realistic savings.",

      "customer_question": "What if no one at home during the day?",
      "ideal_answer": "Even with only 30% daytime usage, the system still drops your RM300 bill to around RM50 because export credit still offsets a big portion.",
      "alternative_phrasings": [
        "Low daytime usage still works — export income fills the gap.",

      "objection": "What if TNB tariff changes?",
      "rebuttal": "Your savings depend mostly on your usage and the NEM structure. As long as those remain, your returns stay stable — our calculations already assume conservative conditions.",
